    <p>
      IELTS for UKVI is a UK government-approved Secure English Language Test (SELT). This means that IELTS can be used to prove your English language abilities in support of a UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI) application.
    </p>
    </p> To find out whether you need to take an approved SELT test, what level you need to achieve and which test you can use, please <a href="s://www.ieltsasia.org/vn/en/study-in-uk/ukvi">click here.<a></p>

    <p>
      The actual test taken is the same for both IELTS and IELTS for UKVI, with the same content, examiners, format, level of difficulty, scoring and so on. The only difference between the two is that IELTS for UKVI is administered in a test venue with video recording and CCTV facilities.
    </p>
    <p>The Listening, Reading and Writing components of all IELTS tests are completed on the same day. The order in which these tests are taken may vary. There are no breaks between these three tests. The Speaking component, however, can be completed up to a week before or after the other tests.</p>

    <p> There are four sections, which include both monologues and conversations. A variety of voices and accents are used and each section is played only once.</p>
